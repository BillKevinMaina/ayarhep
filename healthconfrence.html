                           This three-day event was designed to:

Foster partnerships and strengthen collaboration among diverse stakeholders in the health ecosystem. <br>

Enhance resilience and equity within the health system to ensure quality and accessible service delivery. <br>

Promote research generation and application by translating evidence into policy and practice. <br>

Encourage innovation, technology adoption, and sustainable health financing as core drivers of UHC progress. <br>

These goals created a solid foundation for meaningful dialogue and collaboration throughout the congress.

<h1>Implementers and Stakeholders </h1>
The activity was implemented under the YOU(TH)CARE Project by AYARHEP (African Youth and Adolescent Reproductive Health Program) in collaboration with:


Nairobi City County Health Department, <br>


KAVI Institute of Clinical Research, <br>


Academic institutions,   <br>


Civil society organizations, <br>


Private sector partners who supported exhibitions, mentorship, and innovation showcases. <br>


Together, these partners ensured a structured and participatory approach — from strategic planning and abstract reviews to organizing plenary sessions, side events, and exhibitions. The involvement of young people from AYARHEP symbolized the growing recognition that youth voices are essential in shaping the future of healthcare.

The congress kicked off with an energizing opening ceremony that brought together leaders from the Nairobi City County Health Department, KAVI Institute of Clinical Research, and various partner organizations. The atmosphere was filled with hope and purpose as speakers highlighted the importance of collaboration, inclusion, and innovation in achieving Universal Health Coverage.

The AYARHEP youth delegation made their presence felt from the start — actively engaging in discussions on how young people can shape the future of healthcare through advocacy, digital innovation, and community mobilization.

Throughout the day, participants attended plenary sessions that explored key topics such as:

Strengthening health system resilience after the COVID-19 era. <br>

The role of evidence-based decision-making in policy reform. <br>

How technology can bridge gaps in healthcare access for marginalized populations. <br>

By evening, the energy was electric. Participants connected with peers, shared ideas, and reflected on the day’s discussions, ready to transform insights into action.

                        <h1>day 2 </h1>
<h2>Collaboration in Action  Sharing Knowledge, Shaping Policy</h2>
                         Day two was all about exchange and collaboration. The day began with thematic sessions where researchers presented their abstracts and shared findings on issues ranging from public health innovations to digital health solutions. AYARHEP youth joined these sessions with curiosity and enthusiasm, learning how research can drive real policy change. <br>

Side events and exhibitions added even more color to the day. Health startups showcased innovative technologies — from mobile health apps to data systems improving service delivery. The youth participants were particularly drawn to digital health demonstrations, seeing firsthand how technology is transforming healthcare in Kenya and beyond. <br>

Panel discussions centered on equity, inclusivity, and sustainable health financing, reminding everyone that progress toward UHC requires leaving no one behind. AYARHEP members also engaged in conversations about youth inclusion, emphasizing that meaningful participation of young people must go beyond attendance — it must shape decisions. <br>

By the end of day two, the spirit of partnership had grown stronger, and participants began drafting key recommendations to guide future UHC efforts.

                      <p>
                        <h2>Moving Forward — From Dialogue to Commitment</h2>
                    The final day carried a sense of purpose and optimism. As the congress drew to a close, the focus shifted from discussions to commitment and action.

Morning sessions reviewed the outcomes of previous days and refined policy recommendations to be shared with stakeholders. The youth of AYARHEP took part in dialogues on research translation, health equity, and community-led solutions, ensuring that youth perspectives were embedded in the final resolutions. <br>

The congress concluded with a closing plenary that celebrated collective achievements. Partners reaffirmed their dedication to scaling up innovations, promoting inclusivity, and sustaining collaboration beyond the event. For AYARHEP, it was a proud moment — a validation that young people are not just participants but partners in health transformation. <br>

As participants exchanged final reflections and contacts, one message resonated through the hall: achieving Universal Health Coverage is possible — but only through shared effort, evidence-driven action, and the voices of all generations.
